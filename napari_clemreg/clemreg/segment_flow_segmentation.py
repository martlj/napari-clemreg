"""EM segmentation via Crick's AI-on-Demand (Segment-Flow), as an
alternative to the bundled empanada-dl path -- which is currently
blocked entirely on Python 3.11 (empanada-dl hard-pins numpy==1.22,
see issue #5). Shells out to `nextflow run FrancisCrickInstitute/Segment-Flow`
as a subprocess; the model itself runs in Segment-Flow's own isolated
per-model conda env, never in this process -- this process only needs
the lightweight aiod_utils/aiod_registry/pyyaml packages (no heavy ML
dependencies) to build the image manifest CSV and to generate/patch the
model config ourselves (see _build_model_config's docstring for why).

Requires Nextflow and Conda on PATH. Verified end-to-end, not just by
inspection: `segment_flow_em_segmentation` was run directly against a
small synthetic test volume, through a real Nextflow/Segment-Flow
install, producing a correctly-shaped mask back. See the inline notes
below for the real, non-obvious gotchas hit getting there -- none of
them were guessed.

    NXF_VER pins to a Nextflow release known to work with
    SEGMENT_FLOW_REVISION (see its comment above) -- newer Nextflow
    releases hit a real Groovy parse regression against Segment-Flow's
    pipeline script, confirmed directly. Left alone if the caller's own
    environment already sets NXF_VER.

    JAVA_HOME: Nextflow needs a JDK, and very recent ones (confirmed: 26)
    fail with "Unsupported class file major version". macOS's own
    `/usr/libexec/java_home -v <N>` isn't reliable here -- confirmed
    directly that it happily returns a *newer* JDK than requested instead
    of failing, so it can't tell us whether a compatible one is actually
    available. Instead, look directly for a Homebrew-installed
    openjdk@17/21 (the two versions the prerequisite-check error message
    below recommends), under both the Apple Silicon and Intel Homebrew
    prefixes. Left alone if the caller already set JAVA_HOME, or if no
    such install is found -- guessing further would risk pointing at a
    path that doesn't exist.

    VIRTUAL_ENV / venv's own bin/ on PATH: this is what actually broke
    every real setupModel run (previously misdiagnosed as a concurrency
    race -- serializing the pipeline via executor.queueSize didn't fix
    it, which is what led to finding this). `uv run` (and a plain venv
    activation) prepends the venv's bin/ to PATH and sets VIRTUAL_ENV,
    *without* deactivating an already-active conda env. Confirmed
    directly, step by step: with both active at once (VIRTUAL_ENV set,
    CONDA_SHLVL=1), sourcing conda's own activation script for a
    completely different, unrelated env runs successfully and changes
    nothing about the error -- `which python` before and after is
    identical, still the venv's own python -- because conda's activation
    script has no knowledge of the venv's bin/ entry and never removes
    it, so it keeps winning over whatever conda env conda just
    "activated". Nextflow's own per-process conda activation (used by
    setupModel to reach its isolated aiod_registry install) hits exactly
    this. Strip VIRTUAL_ENV and its bin/ from PATH so Nextflow's child
    processes get a clean PATH to manage their own conda environments,
    unaffected by whatever Python environment launched napari itself.
