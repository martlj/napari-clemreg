"""Segment-Flow EM segmentation integration (modernisation plan §4a,
issue #5 tighter-integration option).

Most of this is testable without Nextflow: prerequisite checking and the
revision pin. The real end-to-end test needs an actual Nextflow + Conda
install (and, on some systems, a specific JDK -- see the module
docstring), so it's marked slow and additionally skipped outright if
those tools aren't on PATH, rather than failing CI (which has neither).
