"""Characterisation tests (modernisation plan §0.1.2).

Unlike the deterministic unit tests, these pin what the pipeline does
*today* on a fixed synthetic input, with tolerance, as the regression
oracle for future dependency bumps (numpy/scipy/scikit-image) and the
napari 0.6.6 upgrade. Some drift across dependency versions is expected;
the tolerance bands below are where "acceptable drift" is encoded --
if a bump moves these counts outside the band, that's a deliberate
signal to look closer, not necessarily a bug.
