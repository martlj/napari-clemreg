# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Remotes

This is a personal fork (`martlj/napari-clemreg`) of `krentzd/napari-clemreg`. `origin` is the fork; `upstream` is the original. Push work to `origin`; only pull from `upstream` to sync in changes from the original project.

## Branching

`modernisation` is the fork's default branch (since 2026-09-23) and its integration branch. `main` is a clean mirror of upstream and is not the default: never commit fork-specific work there. Modernisation work happens on `modernisation` via one branch per issue, e.g. `6-mobie-export`, merged in via PR. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full workflow before starting new work.

## Commands

Install the plugin locally (Python 3.9 recommended, per README):

```
conda create -n clemreg_env python=3.9
conda activate clemreg_env
pip install "napari[all]"
pip install -e .
```

Run the test suite (uses tox, matching CI's per-Python/per-OS matrix):

```
tox
```

Run tests directly with pytest against the active environment:

```
pytest -v --color=yes --cov=napari_clemreg --cov-report=xml
```

Run a single test file or test:

```
pytest napari_clemreg/_tests/test_warp_image_volume.py
pytest napari_clemreg/_tests/test_warp_image_volume.py::test_name
```

Widget tests: `test_dock_widget.py` checks that every widget and dock widget builds. `test_widget_behaviour.py` runs them: it calls each widget and clicks each **Run this step** button against a `napari.components.ViewerModel` (no real window, so it works locally under `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`), with the `widget_components.run_*` pipeline functions replaced by recording stubs. Add a test there for any change to widget wiring. Known open GUI bugs are pinned there as `xfail(strict=True)` tests naming their issue, so remove the marker when fixing one. Unit tests for the pure math in `clemreg/` are also under `napari_clemreg/_tests/` (see §0 of the modernisation plan below).

**macOS: torch + napari can segfault on import** (two OpenMP runtimes loaded in one process — torch's bundled `libiomp5` vs. the conda-forge `libomp` napari's stack pulls in). `napari_clemreg/_tests/conftest.py` sets `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` and `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1` before those imports, so pytest runs are unaffected; if you import `napari_clemreg` (or `torch` then `napari`) directly in a script or REPL, set those env vars first. No-op on Linux CI.

Two kinds of tests are opt-in:
- **Slow** (`@pytest.mark.slow`, run with `--run-slow`): real sample-data downloads, reader checks on the real Zenodo files, and `test_gui_end_to_end.py`, which runs Run Registration step by step on the real sample data (about 2 minutes, about 2.5 GB of memory). CI's per-push `tests` workflow skips them. The `slow tests` workflow runs them after each merge into `modernisation` (except docs-only changes), weekly, and on demand (Actions tab → "slow tests" → Run workflow). With tox, pass the flag through: `tox -- --run-slow`.
- **Real Viewer** (`test_real_viewer.py`, runs only with `CLEMREG_REAL_VIEWER=1`): opens each dock widget in a real napari Viewer through the npe2 manifest. CI sets the variable on Linux. Locally it works with the native macOS Qt platform but segfaults under `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`, which is why it's opt-in.

There are pre-existing local conda envs for this repo:
- `clemreg_env` (python 3.9) — matches the **pre-#3** `setup.cfg` pins the repo actually ships and installs cleanly today (has `napari-clemreg` installed editable from this checkout via `pip install -e . --no-deps`). Use this for day-to-day work and for the §0 characterisation baseline, since `setup.cfg`'s `python_requires` now says `>=3.11` but a real `pip install` still can't resolve on 3.11 until #5 (`empanada-dl`) is unblocked.
- `clemreg-py311-verify` (python 3.11) — built to empirically verify the #3 (Python 3.11) dependency bump. Has every `setup.cfg` dependency installed at its latest available version **except `empanada-dl`** (deliberately excluded, since it's the #5 blocker) — `napari-clemreg` is installed editable via `pip install -e . --no-deps` here too. The full test suite passes here (30 passed, 1 xfailed) as of the #3 work. Reuse this env rather than rebuilding it for further Python 3.11 verification; extend it if you need to test a newer pin.
- `napari-clemreg-311` and `napari-clemreg` (no suffix) — both broken (numpy/scikit-image ABI mismatches from earlier, less careful upgrade attempts). Not worth fixing; superseded by `clemreg-py311-verify`.

**macOS: open3d's wheel needs `libusb`** (`brew install libusb`) or it fails to import with a `dlopen`/`Library not loaded` error. Not a napari-clemreg issue — open3d's compiled binary links against it unconditionally.

## Architecture

The plugin has two layers under `napari_clemreg/`:

- **`widgets/`** — thin `magicgui`-based napari GUI entry points (`run_registration.py`, `fixed_segmentation.py`, `moving_segmentation.py`, `point_cloud_sampling.py`, `registration_warping.py`). These are registered as napari commands/widgets in `napari_clemreg/napari.yaml`, the plugin manifest read by napari's plugin engine (npe2). Widget functions handle UI wiring, parameter forms (`clemreg/on_init_specs.py` defines widget layout specs), and threading via napari's `thread_worker`/`GeneratorWorker`.
- **`clemreg/`** — the actual algorithm/glue code, napari-independent aside from layer types and threading helpers:
  - `widget_components.py` — glue functions (e.g. `run_moving_segmentation`) called by the widgets, chaining together the pipeline steps below.
  - `log_segmentation.py`, `empanada_segmentation.py` — FM (Laplacian-of-Gaussian) and EM (MitoNet/empanada-dl) segmentation.
  - `mask_roi.py`, `data_preprocessing.py` — ROI masking and isotropic resampling.
  - `point_cloud_sampling.py`, `point_cloud_registration.py` — point-cloud extraction from segmentations and registration (Rigid/Affine CPD, BCPD via `probreg`).
  - `warp_image_volume.py` — warps the moving image volume using the resulting point-cloud transform.
  - `sample_data.py` — provides the built-in napari sample dataset.
- `napari_clemreg/_reader.py` — napari file reader hook (`.tif`/`.tiff`, directories).

The full pipeline (EM segmentation → FM segmentation → point-cloud sampling → point-cloud registration → image warping) can be run end-to-end via the `Run registration` widget, or each stage run independently via the numbered "split registration" widgets — both paths call into the same `clemreg/` functions.

### In-progress package split

`packages/clemreg/` is a placeholder (version `0.0.0`, reserving the PyPI name) for a standalone, napari-free `clemreg` core package, which the plugin will depend on. **Read [docs/design/package-split.md](docs/design/package-split.md) before changing anything in `napari_clemreg/clemreg/`**. It defines the boundary: the four `run_*` functions in `widget_components` stay as the plugin's layer-to-array adapters, and the core takes arrays, `PixelSize` (µm), `Params` and `Transform`, and raises `ClemregError` subclasses. Status is on [#7](https://github.com/martlj/napari-clemreg/issues/7) and its phase sub-issues (#57–#61), not in the doc. Record design changes in the doc's decisions log, not as "update" notes.

The original modernisation plan (testing foundation, Python 3.11, napari upgrade, MoBIE export, and the repo/PyPI/release strategy; its §6 on the split now points to the design doc) is in [docs/napari-clemreg-modernisation-plan.md](docs/napari-clemreg-modernisation-plan.md) — read it before starting work related to any of those areas.

## Packaging

The root package (`napari-clemreg`, the napari plugin) is defined via `setup.cfg`/`setup.py` (no `pyproject.toml`). `python_requires = >=3.11` as of the #3 modernisation work, with most pins loosened to `>=` per the plan's §1.2 table. Heavy dependencies (`napari`, `open3d`, `probreg`) make installs slow.

`empanada-dl` (needed only by the bundled EM Segmentation/MitoNet widget, along with `torch`) is **not** in `install_requires` — it lives in its own `empanada` extra (`pip install napari-clemreg[empanada]`). It's still hard-pinned at `==0.1.7`, and its own `numpy==1.22` pin still has no Python 3.11 wheels, so that one extra still won't resolve on Python 3.11 (see [issue #5](https://github.com/martlj/napari-clemreg/issues/5)) — but this is now scoped to just that extra rather than blocking the base install entirely, since a normal `pip install napari-clemreg` (or the `segment-flow` extra, see below) resolves and works fine without it (verified empirically, both in `clemreg-py311-verify` and via a clean dependency-resolution dry run against Python 3.11).

For EM segmentation on Python 3.11 today, use the `segment-flow` extra instead (`clemreg/segment_flow_segmentation.py`) — see the widgets' `EM Segmentation Backend` dropdown.

## CHANGELOG and ROADMAP

Keep [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) in step with every merged PR (standing instruction, 2026-09-23).

**In each PR you open:** update both files in the PR itself, so they're correct the moment it merges.
- CHANGELOG: add an entry under `[Unreleased]`, linking the PR and issue. Use `Added`/`Changed`/`Fixed`/`Removed` for anything users would notice. Tests, CI and project docs go under `Development`. Mark breaking changes `**Breaking:**`, and check that the `[Unreleased]` header's proposed version still fits the bump rules below.
- ROADMAP: remove or rewrite anything the PR finishes, and add follow-ups, open decisions or bugs it uncovers, with issue links. The ROADMAP only lists what's still to do. What's done belongs in the CHANGELOG.
- If the PR closes an issue, or finishes a sub-issue of #7, check that the issue (and the [package split design](docs/design/package-split.md), if relevant) agrees.

**After a merge:** when you're told a PR has merged, and at the start of a session before other work, cross-check. List the PRs merged into `modernisation` since the newest PR linked in the CHANGELOG (`gh pr list -R martlj/napari-clemreg --base modernisation --state merged`). Also look for ROADMAP items those PRs finished and issues they fixed that are still open. Fix any gaps in one catch-up PR. Don't merge it, as with any other PR.

## Closing issues

`modernisation` is the default branch, so GitHub closes an issue when a merged PR's description (or a commit message) contains a closing keyword before its number: *close(s/d)*, *fix(es/ed)*, *resolve(s/d)*. It matches the keyword **anywhere**, including prose, negations and future tense. "doesn't fully fix #53" closed #53 (PR #67), and "(fixes #47)", written about planned work, closed #47 while it was still broken (PR #62; reopened).

- **Only** write a closing keyword before an issue number when the PR completely resolves that issue, e.g. `Fixes #50` in the summary.
- Everywhere else, refer to issues without one: "part of #58", "for #47", "see #53", "#47 is planned for phase 1". Avoid "fix"/"close"/"resolve" directly before `#N` in any wording, and check the PR description for this before opening it.

**After a merge** (as part of the cross-check under *CHANGELOG and ROADMAP*):
1. Check every issue the merge closed was actually resolved by it. Reopen any closed by mistake, with a comment explaining why.
2. Close issues the merge **unambiguously** completed, with a comment linking the PR. That means:
   - every task-list item is ticked, and the work for them is merged; or
   - the issue's stated outcome is demonstrably delivered, e.g. the strict-xfail test pinned to it now passes and its marker has been removed; or
   - it's a parent issue (like #7) and all its sub-issues are closed.
3. Tick task-list items the merge completed, on the issue itself and on tracking issues such as #8 and #58.
4. Don't close anything ambiguous, e.g. partly done, or needing a decision or a manual check. List those for the user instead.

## Versioning

`setup.cfg`'s `version` (currently `0.2.1`) hasn't been bumped since this fork's modernisation work began, despite several release-worthy batches of work having landed. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)'s status note and [issue #1](https://github.com/martlj/napari-clemreg/issues/1) for the real release/versioning decision, which hasn't been made yet.

When a merged (or about-to-be-merged) change is release-worthy, suggest a follow-up commit that bumps `setup.cfg`'s `version` and adds the matching `CHANGELOG.md` entry. Don't apply it unilaterally: versioning and release timing are the user's call. Every suggestion must say **which level (patch, minor or major) and why**, using the rules below. Don't default to minor.

`setup.cfg`'s `version` is the only place the version is defined (`napari_clemreg/__init__.py` reads it via `importlib.metadata`). It changes only in a release commit. That commit sets `version`, renames the CHANGELOG's `[Unreleased]` heading to that version with the date, and is the commit that gets tagged (`vX.Y.Z`). Between releases, `setup.cfg` keeps the last released version. Never go back and bump it for CHANGELOG batches that were never tagged or published: those numbers are just labels, and the first real release sets `version` straight to the latest one. Tags and releases belong on the canonical upstream or Crick-org repo, not this fork (plan §7.7).

### Choosing the bump level

The "public surface" here means: the widgets and their parameters, the `napari.yaml` command/widget/sample-data IDs, importable Python APIs, the install requirements and extras (Python version, `install_requires`, extra names), and the outputs users get by default (layer shapes, scales, file formats).

- **Patch** (`x.y.Z`): bug fixes only, with no new features and no change to the public surface. A fix that restores the documented or intended behaviour is a patch, even if it changes results.
- **Minor** (`x.Y.0`): new features, new options or new backends added in a backwards-compatible way, deprecations, and changed defaults that still leave the old behaviour available as an option.
- **Major** (`X.0.0`): anything that breaks existing users, such as removing or renaming a widget, parameter, extra or import path, raising the minimum Python, adding a hard dependency that won't install somewhere it used to, or changing default outputs with no way back to the old ones.
- **No bump:** docs, CI, tests or refactors that ship nothing different to users. These go in the next release's entry, if they're worth mentioning at all.

A batch takes the highest level of any change in it. A fix to a feature added in the same unreleased batch is part of that feature, not a separate patch.

**While pre-1.0** (the current state; plan §7.7): anything that would be a major bump is a **minor** bump instead. Flag it as `**Breaking:**` in the CHANGELOG entry, and still bump patch for fix-only batches. SemVer's 0.x rules allow anything to change, but keeping the patch/minor distinction tells users which upgrades are safe.

### When to declare 1.0.0

1.0.0 is a promise that the public surface is stable. It doesn't measure how much has changed. Suggest it only once all of these are true, and say which of them still aren't:

1. The package split ([#7](https://github.com/martlj/napari-clemreg/issues/7)) has landed and settled, and the public API of `clemreg` (the core package) and of `napari_clemreg` is written down (what's public and what's internal).
2. No known breaking changes are still queued on [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md). For example, the OME-Zarr work must either have landed or be designed so it only adds to the current behaviour.
3. Every documented install path resolves on the supported Pythons: the `empanada` extra is fixed or dropped ([#5](https://github.com/martlj/napari-clemreg/issues/5)).
4. Widget-level tests exist, so the stability promise can actually be checked in CI.
5. The release is cut from the canonical upstream or Crick-org repo, not this fork ([#1](https://github.com/martlj/napari-clemreg/issues/1), plan §7.7), so the tag gets the Zenodo DOI and `CITATION.cff`.

After the split, `clemreg` and `napari-clemreg` are versioned independently. Each reaches 1.0 on its own merits, with criterion 1 applied to that package's own API.
